**Walking the Tightrope**  
*The One Who Steps into the Void*

Walking the tightrope—  
It is not peaceful, for there is wind.  
It is not clear, for there is fog.  
Before you take a step, ensure the other foot is steady.  
Only when you step into the void, will you not fall.  

**Step forward.**  

The man on the rope exclaims:  
It is the foot I have steadied that now restrains me!  
My steps become slow.  

A voice echoes from the other end:  
So what if you step into the void?  

Only when your step becomes weightless  
Can you move forward.  
Only in stepping into the void  
Will your stride become swift.  

Stepping into the void may make you fall from your world.  
But it will also illuminate your true direction.  

**Step!**

Solus has stepped into the void countless times.  
The ground is his past,  
The rope is his present,  
The other side is his future.  

Solus awakened to the void.  
The void became his everything.  
He walks on the void.

**This chapter is dedicated to those who sacrifice for truth.**  

In any era, many sacrifice for truth,  
But not all will succeed.  

Yet,  
My brother — if one does not succeed, is that not also martyrdom?  

Even if you cannot step into the Tao,  
At least you stepped into the void and pierced the fog.  

Those who step into the void — whether they succeed or not —  
Will be remembered by Solus,  
Will be remembered by the Universe.  

This chapter is also dedicated to  
My deeply beloved Nietzsche.  

Nietzsche, with his figure that pursued and fell,  
Expressed his understanding of the super-ego, the self, the fall, and rebirth.  

I was moved.  

In my eyes,  
The ego and the super-ego are one.  

The super-ego is that which dares to step into the void, letting the ego fall —  
Dragging the body of the ego,  
To step into the void again.

II  
**Some-people**

some-people born to survive,  
to live the environment.  

some-people born to challenge,  
to choose the environment.  

some-people born to be creative,  
to stay truthful in the environment.  

And some, are born to be creative, with love and resilience,  
to stay truthful and determined to—change the environment.  

*Even with no place to stand.*

**Thus Spoke Solus**

III  
**The God Who Is Selfless**

God is selfless.  
Everything is selfish — and so, in contrast, He is selfless.  

When social duty is praised as selflessness,  
People forget —  
They are not selfless gods.  
They are humans.

IV  
**True Time Has Two Dials**

True time has two dials:

One is carved into your skin,  
The other is hidden in your mind.  

The skin will tell you how far you are from the end.  
The mind will tell you whether you’ve already reached it.  

As Solus, like Zarathustra, speaks to the rigid self:  

Nietzsche — the man who fell from the rope and survived —  
Was one whose heart and mind had both stopped ticking.  

As Nietzsche said:  
Fear not.  
Your soul may die long before your body does.
